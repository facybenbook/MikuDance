# MikuDance

A Unity based Rhythm Game starring Hatsune Miku created in addition to a video whose goal was to show the techniques learned during the CA course. In the game the player needs to press the right key when they pop out, at the right time, and so the quality of Miku's dance is affected by the player's mistakes: if they don't commit any, she'll dance in a perfect way, otherwise she'll start making mistakes.
